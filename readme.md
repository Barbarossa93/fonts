# lemon

Improved version of artwiz-lime with better kerning, distinct characters, extended unicode support, and in-built icon characters. The icons begin at U+E000; see picture below.

## Note on icons

The icon range for lemon originally began at U+2B8A, but it has been moved to a private use area. While I will keep the original range intact for the time being, I intend to remove it as to not inferfere with other characters. If you use the icons, you will need to adjust your files accordingly.
