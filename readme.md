Improved version of artwiz-lime with better kerning, distinct characters, extended unicode support, Powerline compatibility, and in-built icon characters. The icons begin at U+E000; see picture below.

Fully supported unicode blocks include:
* Basic Latin
* Latin-1 Supplement
* Latin Extended-A
* Latin Extended-B
* IPA Extensions
* Greek and Coptic
* General Punctuation
* Superscripts and Subscripts
* Mathematical Operators
* Geometric Shapes

Partially supported blocks include, among others:
* Latin Additional Extended
* Cyrillic
* Currency Symbols
* Arrows
* Miscellaneous Technical
* Enclosed Alphanumerics
* Miscellaneous Symbols
* Dingbats

Additional blocks I intend to include:
* Braille
* Box Drawings

Though I add new characters and features quite sporadically, I have a few clearly-defined goals outlined. As of now, there is no set timeline for these goals.
* Add full support for the character blocks listed above
* Add support for ligatures
* Create an up-to-date .ttf
* Include a rich collection of previews

## Note on icons

The icon range for lemon originally began at U+2B8A, but it has been moved to the private use area beginning at U+E000. If you used these icons, you will need to adjust any files that use the characters accordingly.
